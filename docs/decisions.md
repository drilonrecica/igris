# Decisions log

Each P0 task records its evidence and recommendation here. The owner approves; `SPEC.md` is amended where affected.

## P0-01 — Dependency approval list

Versions and release dates are from the Go module proxy (checked 2026-10-06). Licenses are the upstream repository licenses.

| Candidate | Purpose | Latest (date) | License | Stdlib alternative | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `charmbracelet/bubbletea` | TUI runtime (SPEC §15) | v1.3.10 (2025-09) | MIT | none practical (raw termios + redraw loop) | **Approve** |
| `charmbracelet/bubbles` | Ready-made table/viewport/textinput widgets | v1.0.0 (2026-02) | MIT | hand-roll widgets | **Approve** — only the components we use |
| `charmbracelet/lipgloss` | Styling/layout, narrow vs wide layout (SPEC §15.2) | v1.1.0 (2025-03) | MIT | raw ANSI strings | **Approve** |
| `charmbracelet/x/exp/teatest` | Drive Bubble Tea models in tests (AGENTS §5) | pseudo-version (2026-10-04) | MIT | hand-driven `Update` calls | **Approve, test-only** — pre-release (`x/exp`), so pin the exact version and keep it out of the shipped binary |
| `BurntSushi/toml` | `igris.toml` loader (SPEC §12) | v1.6.0 (2025-12) | MIT | none (no TOML in stdlib) | **Approve** — `MetaData.Undecoded()` gives the strict unknown-key errors M0-06 needs directly |
| `pelletier/go-toml/v2` | alternative TOML lib | v2.4.3 (2026-07) | MIT | — | Reject — faster, but strict mode is less ergonomic for our error messages; speed is irrelevant for one small file |
| `spf13/cobra` | CLI parsing | v1.10.2 (2025-12) | Apache-2.0 | stdlib `flag` | Reject — ~10 subcommands with few flags; `flag.FlagSet` per subcommand in `cmd/igris/` is enough and avoids a large transitive tree |
| `sergi/go-diff` / `pmezard/go-difflib` | diff rendering for `igris adapt` | v1.4.0 / v1.0.0 (2016, unmaintained) | MIT / BSD-3 | hand-rolled | Reject — `adapt` shows a line diff of a table; a small LCS line differ (~60 lines, fully tested) avoids a dependency |

### Proposed approved list (awaiting owner approval)

- `github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea`
- `github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles`
- `github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss`
- `github.com/charmbracelet/x/exp/teatest` (tests only)
- `github.com/BurntSushi/toml`

Anything else (including their transitive dependencies being swapped, or adding cobra/a diff library later) needs a new decision task first (AGENTS §4). No CGO.
